# 🏃 FitPulse – Health Anomaly Detection System

## 🚀 Overview
FitPulse is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for analyzing fitness device data and detecting health anomalies.

Built as an interactive Streamlit application, it enables users to upload time-series data, visualize trends, forecast behavior, and identify anomalies through a unified dashboard.

This project simulates a real-world health monitoring system used in wearable technology and preventive healthcare.
